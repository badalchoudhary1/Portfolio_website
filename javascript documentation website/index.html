      				Javascript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host enviroment (for example, a web browser), Javascript can be connected to the object of its enviroment to provide programmatic control over them.
      			</p>
      			<p>
      				Javascript contains a standard libraray of objects, such as array, Date and Math,and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures , and statements. Core Javascript can be exented for a variety of purpose by supplementing it with additional for a variety of purpose by supplementing it with additional objects;for example
      			</p>
      			<ul>
      				<li>Client-side Javascript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document object model(dom)
      				for example clientside extension allow an application to place elements on an html form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input and page navigation.</li>
      				<li>
      					Server-side Javascript extends the core langyuage by supplying objects relevent to running Javascript on a server for example server side extension allow an application to communite with a database, provide continuity of information from invocation  to another of the application , or application or perform file manipulation on a server.

      				<li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (Html).</li>

      	<h2>JavaScript and Java</h2>
      	<article>
      		<p>
      			JavaScript and Java are similer in some ways but fundamentally different in some others.The javascript language resembles java but does not java static typing and strong type checking .
      			Javascript follows most Javascript follows most Java expression syntax naming conventions and basic control flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from liveScript to Javascript.
      		</p>
      		<p>
      			In contrast to java's Compile-time system of classes built by declaration javascript supports a runtime system based ona small number of datatypes representing numeric boolean and string values. Javascript  has a protype based model provides dynamic inherutance that is wht is inhreted can vary for individual objects. javascript also supports funstions without any special declaratives requrements functions can be proprties of objects executing as lossely typed method.
      		</p>
      		<p>
      			Javascript is a very free from language compared to java you do not have to declare all variable classes and methods you don not have to be conceeend with whether methods are public private or protected and you do not have to implement interfaces . Variables parameters and functions return types are not explicity typed.
      		</p>

      	<section id="Hello_world">
      		<h2>Hello world</h2>
      		<article>
      			To get started with Javascript open the Scratchpad  and write your first Hello world Javascript code:
      			<code >
      				function greetme (yourname){alert("Hello"+ yourName);}
      				greetMe("World");
      			</code>
      			Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!

      	<section id="Variables">
      		<h2>Variables</h2>
      		<article>
      			<p>
      				You use variables as symbolic names for values in application. The name of variales , called identifiers,conform to certain rules.
      			</p>
      			<p>
      				A Javascript identifier must start with a letter , underscore (_),or dollor sign(subsquent) character can also be digit Because Javascript is case sensitive letter include include the character "a"thriugh "z"(uppercase) and the character "a" through "z" (lowercase)
      			</p>
      			<p>
      				You can use ISo 8869 or Unicode letter such as a and u in identifier . you can also use the unicode esape sequences as character in identifiers some example of legal names are number hits temps and name.
